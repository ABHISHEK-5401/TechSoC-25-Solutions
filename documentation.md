Hello Everyone This Code is by Abhishek Verma
In this code I have made seperate functions to perform all the mathematical operations

## Explanation of Calculator.java

This Java program implements a simple calculator with a menu-driven interface. The user is prompted to select a mathematical operation from a list, and the program then calls the corresponding function to perform the calculation. Each operation (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division, Power, Square Root, Natural Logarithm, Exponential, and Trigonometric functions) is implemented as a separate static method.

**How it works:**
- The `main` method displays a menu and takes the user's choice as input.
- Based on the user's selection, a `switch` statement calls the appropriate function.
- Each function prompts the user for the required input(s), performs the calculation, and displays the result.
- The program uses the `Scanner` class to handle user input.

This modular approach makes the code easy to read, maintain, and extend with additional operations
